\section{JMP}

JMP (pronounced \textit{Jump}) is an enterprise level statistical
analysis tool developed by SAS. The JMP software package is designed
to handle every data-involved stage from acquisition to
presentation. JMP is capable of complex analysis and can provide the
user the back-end software code generated to produce the visualized
results. A single JMP license is available for 1,785
USD~\cite{JMPSAS}. JMP Pro is an even more capable version of JMP with
more advanced analytics and predictive modeling with
cross-validation--available for 14,900 USD~\cite{JMPPro}.\footnote{Please fix labels.}

Cascading is an open source data processing project started in early
<<<<<<< HEAD
2008. Cascading functions as a work flow workhorse within the Apache
Hadoop platform and serves as an alternative API to MapReduce. The
Cascading Ecosystems includes multiple project extensions for
compatibility with multiple languages, platforms, and
functions~\cite{hid-sp18-507-CascadingEco}. Originally written in
Java, the Cascading platform can be run on any JVM and includes
extensions for application development using Domain Specific Languages
(DSLs) such as Python, Ruby, Scala or
Clojure~\cite{hid-sp18-507-GitHubCascading}. Cascading and the
Cascading ecosystem were originally designed to be used with the
Apache Hadoop MapR distribution for the purpose of developing
data-rich applications with analysis and machine learning
capabilities~\cite{hid-sp18-507-MapR}.The open source platform an all
extensions are available through the Apache Public License.

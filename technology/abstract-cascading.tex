Cascading is an open source data processing project started in early
2008. Cascading functions as a workflow workhorse within the Apache Hadoop
platform and serves as an alternative API to MapReduce. The Cascading Ecosystems
includes multiple project extensions for compatibility with multiple languages,
platforms, and functions\cite{CascadingEco}. Originally written in Java, the
Cascading platform can be run on any JVM and includes extensions for application
development using Scala or Clojure. The open source platform an all extensions

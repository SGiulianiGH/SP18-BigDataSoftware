\section{Openchain}

Openchain is a blockchain ledger technology designed to be built in seconds and
deployed on an enterprise scale for the purposes of managing asset
transactions. The Openchain technology uses a distributed client-server
architecture rather than the slower peer-to-peer proof of work concept
originally adopted by early blockchain technologies. Openchain can serve as a
stand alone ledger or can be scaled as a side-ledger to existing blockchain
platforms~\cite{Openchain}.

\section{Scribe}

Scribe is a server, originally developed and maintained by Facebook in 2008,
that serves as an aggregator for streaming log data. The Scribe server is
deployed within each node of a network and sends the aggregated log data to a
central server for analysis. The data is interpreted by the Scribe servers via a
two-string input by a client: the category or direction, and the message
itself. Scribe has been deployed on thousands of servers on a single network and
is robust to network errors and failures~\cite{FBScribe}. Scribe is available
via the Apache License v.2.

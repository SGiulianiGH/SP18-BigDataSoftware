\subsection{Giuliani, Stephen}
Stephen Giuliani, having grown up in Northern Virginia, chose to begin his 
career in the area as a consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton, a prominent 
technology and management consulting firm in the greater Washington D.C. 
metro area. Since graduating with an undergraduate degree in Business Finance 
from Christopher Newport University's Luter School of Business, he has spent 
his tenure with Booz Allen developing his skills as a financial analyst and 
cost estimator.
With a rise in demand for data science and data-based capabilities in the 
workforce, he chose to pivot his career away from management consulting toward 
a data-driven career and began his pursuit of a Masters from Indiana 
University's School of Informatics and Computing. Mr. Giuliani has studied 
courses focused on single computer languages, statistical analysis, machine 
learning, and artificial intelligence.
Upon completion of the Master's program, he intends to continue his career as 
a data scientist with Booz Allen, who aims to position themselves as a leader 
in data-focused-consulting. He lives with his wife and 5-month old son in 
Northern Virginia and hopes to apply his graduate studies within his career 
and personal endeavors.

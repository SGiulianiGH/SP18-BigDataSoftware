# Spring 2018: Big Data & Open Source Software

The documents contained within this repository were originally produced as a part of the I-524 course, Big Data & Software (focus on open source)
Some documents were not created by myself, but rather, were created by the instructor, Gregor von Laszewski, or his TAs, for purposes of streamlining and aggregating student's work.

    The primary language used is Python (3.6) and papers were written using Latex. 
    This repository is not set up for a viewer's ability to replicate efforts but serves 
    to demonstrate my ability to use multiple languages and technologies.

## REST

REST, or Representational State Transfer, is a popularly used (yet, non-standard) communications protocol and the purpose of this assignment was to simply demonstrate my ability to produce a RESTful service. This example is designed to produce operating system information as queried via curl calls.

## Paper

The files in this folder were used to produce a paper featuring Openchain, and open source blockchain platform. The paper was written in latex and compiled via makefile commands.

## Project Code
As part of a final project, this folder holds the python code used as the basis of the final paper. The focus and purpose f this final project was to demonstrate the ability to use big data platforms and practices to gather, analyze, and produce results on a subject of our choice.
The code includes the ability to scrape data from Twitter's API via a developer account, store that data on MongoDB Atlas cloud service, download and present the data using flask on a local directory, and then saving specific ata and calculations on csv files for final analysis. 
As the focus of the final project was not on the analysis, the calculations and results produced are not indicative of an analytical practice but more of a demonstration of software interactions.

## Project Paper

**"Analyzing Twitter Activity to Identify Spam Accounts"**

The output documents as part of the final project. This analysis of this paper speculates spam accounts on twitter by analyzing users' activity and account metrics.
+ **Note** :: The pdf within this folder was compiled by the professor as a part of the course "handbook". I am the sole author of this paper and therefore extracted only my final project contribution to the full handbook.

## Swagger

This assignment was to demonstrate our ability to use swagger-codegen to produce API-friendly documentation.

## Technology

Each student was required to provide abstracts on relevant technology used today. My contributions include abstracts of Facebook's Scribe, Openchain, Elasticsearch, Cascading, and SAS: JMP.

## Tutorial

As a follow-on to the Paper assignment, I chose to create a tutorial for setting up your own blckchain environment. Using Openchain, you can stand up your own blockchain nodes as well as provide a wallet for managing the assets tracked via the open source blockchain technology.
